# Useless UK Town Facts

For any given letter, find the name of the longest UK locality (Town, Village, etc) from the set containing the most instances of that letter.
For example for 'e', in this list:
  Fleetwood
  Manchester
  Wolverhampton
  Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch
'Manchester' and 'Fleetwood' both contain 'e' twice and, of those, 'Manchester' is the longest.
